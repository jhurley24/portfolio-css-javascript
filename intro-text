<p class="sqsrte-large">I’m a Senior Experience Designer, currently leading research, strategy, and design at <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">CVS Health</a></span>, focused on creating inclusive solutions that generate positive business and user outcomes.</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Before that, I was a contractor, designing and coding learning and e-commerce experiences for clients including <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">Boston Children’s Hospital</a></span>, <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">GoTo</a></span>, <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">Megafood</a></span>, and <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">Droplette</a></span>.</p> 

<p class="sqsrte-large">Prior to contracting, I cut my teeth at a small innovation firm, <span class="internal"><a href="https://cvshealth.com/" alt="Link to CVS Health website">Cantina</a></span>. While there, I led internal efforts to develop a design system for the agency’s marketing site and several augmented and virtual reality experiments.</p>
